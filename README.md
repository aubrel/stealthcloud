# StealthCloud

StealthCloud is a delicious mixture of Ansible roles that provide the user with an automatic spin-up of a [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) instance hosted on a stealth [Onion service](https://www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services).

StealthCloud utilizes much of the infrastructure provided by [AnarchoTechNYC's ansible-role-tor](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/ansible-role-tor), and you can find a lot of great further explanations of Onion services and specifics there. Whatever differs from those roles will be included in the documentation here.
